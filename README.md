# genshin-rounding

This is a small C# script that parses the artifact substat rolls from the datamine, and produces all the "in-game" rounded roll sum totals from every permulation/combination possible. 

## Running the script
1. Clone a datamine, like https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData.
2. Put the datamine in your `<documents dir>/GenshinData`.
3. Run the binary.
4. Files are ouputted to `<documents dir>/GenshinGenerated`.
